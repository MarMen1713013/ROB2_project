	\textbf{
	In this paper we will face the problem of task priority resolution using a fast computation of the priority matrix (here \textit{Flacco Matrix}) and the resulting joint velocities.}

\textbf{
	Collision avoidance for several control points has been taken as a high priority task in this case as well as trajectory tracking.}

\section*{Introduction}
Due to their high dexterity and the absence of non-holonomic constraints, manipulators has been used to perform a wide range of operation, and sometimes even more of them at the same time.

A handy yet practical example is the one considered below: a manipulator moving in a cluttered environment, trying to complete a trajectory tracking task and, at the same time, avoid collision with obstacles nearby.

\subsection*{Approach}
Due to the high complexity of the task we divided our control scheme into 3 main blocks:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Task priority matrix:} to compute in a fast way the resulting joint velocity, executing the task velocities coming from the prioritized stack of tasks.
	\item \textbf{Priority resolution algorithm:} to organize the stack of tasks depending on the each ones' \textit{generalized cost}.
	This concept will be further explained above.
	\item \textbf{Control algorithm:} to generate the reference joint velocity that the manipulator should execute.
\end{enumerate}

TODO: brief description
\subsection{Assigned tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Trajectory tracking + Collision avoidance 0.
	\item Elbow up (i.e. horizontal).
	\item collision avoidance 1.
	\item collision avoidance 2.
\end{enumerate}
